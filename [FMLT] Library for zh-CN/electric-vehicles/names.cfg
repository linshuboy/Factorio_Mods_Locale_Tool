[technology-description]
electric-vehicles-electric-cars = A more luxurious car powered by electricity with an equipment grid for further enhancements.
electric-vehicles-electric-tanks = They won't even hear you coming...
electric-vehicles-electric-trains = Power your trains with "clean" electricity instead of dirty coal.
electric-vehicles-high-voltage-transformer = Unlocks transformers capable of providing enough power to move heavy duty electric vehicles.
electric-vehicles-regen-braking = Alternate the motors of electric vehicles into generators while they are slowing down to convert some of the absorbed kinetic energy back into electricity. The faster it is going and the heavier it is the more energy is recovered.
